              <p>Must play with either 10 or 6 cups (for party situations 6 cups is preferred to increase the speed of
              play). If played with 10 cups each team gets two re-racks. If played with 6 cups each team gets one
              re-rack. Re-racks can only occur when 6,4,3,2 or 1 cup(s) are present, and must be taken at the
              beginning of a turn. Bouncing into a cup is allowed, so are straight shots.<br><br>
              To begin play, opposing team members must shoot at each other’s cups one at a time. First team to
              make it when opposing team misses gets balls first. The made cup in the opening shoot off does
              not count as a made cup in regulation. </P>

              <p>-If both team members make their shots they get the balls sent back, and in turn, both get to shoot
              again.</p>
              <p>-If the ball touches a cup and bounces up, that defending team can knock the ball away, which is
              called “defense”.</p>
              <p>-If a member of a team knocks a beer over on the court it cannot be replaced. However, this does
              not count as a made cup it simply goes away. Example, Johnny on team one makes a cup and
              Samir on team 2 removes the cup and knocks another over. This doesn’t count as two cups sunk,
              Johnny’s teammate must still make a shot to get the balls back.</p>
              <p>-Any interference by the opposition with the ball while the ball is over the table counts as an
              automatic made cup. The opposition can perform psyche-outs, but may not interfere with a ball in
              play.</p>
              <p>-Two balls in any one cup automatically ends the game in favor of the team that made the shots.</p>
